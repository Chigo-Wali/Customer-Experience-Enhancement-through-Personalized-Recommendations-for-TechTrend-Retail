    Iterative Optimization: Establish a continuous improvement cycle by collecting feedback, analyzing performance metrics, and iteratively optimizing the recommendation engine.

5. Key Questions

    What key segments can be found within the customer group and what are their characteristics?
    What demographic information is most relevant for segmenting customers?
    How can transaction history, interaction types, and customer profiles be used to create meaningful segments?
    What are the key features and characteristics of products that customers frequently purchase together?
    Are there seasonal or trending patterns that should be considered for personalization?
    What support system is most effective? How does support system influence purchase?
    What key performance indicators are measuring the success of the recommendation system?
    How do customer engagement metrics correlate with conversion rates and overall customer satisfaction?
    Are there leading indicators that can predict future success or challenges?
